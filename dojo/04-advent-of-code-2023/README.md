Advent of Code (AoC) is an annual coding challenge that runs from December 1st to 25th. It consists of tasks that become progressively more challenging as Christmas approaches, and that make for some fun logical problem solving. 

In this dojo, we will be working with some of the tasks from AoC 2023 (https://adventofcode.com/2023). The idea is that each dojo starts with whatever task they would like to solve, and then continue with the next task they would like to solve. Each dojo is free to use whatever programming language they want to, however the best is of course ~~Python~~ to choose a language that everyone in the dojo is either familiar with or interested in learning. Possible solutions to the different tasks are available in the `solutions` folder. At the time of writing, only Python solutions from day 1 to day 8 are included, as these are the tasks the organizer has had the time (skill? willpower? lack of laziness?) to solve. Feel free to push your own solutions to the repository as well. 

We will start the dojo with some food and a quick look at the Advent of Code website to give everyone all the information they need to start solving the puzzles.

Suggestions for tasks for those new to AoC:
- Task 1 part a (part b is a little tedious)
- Task 2
- Task 4
- Task 6 (little code involved and the problem has some nice properties allowing for a "smart" solution)

Tasks 5 and 8 are also interesting as they are good examples of why you might want to look at the data before running the code (duh). They also have some computionally heavy components which might require some out-of-the-box solutions.
