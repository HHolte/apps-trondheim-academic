Advent of Code (AoC) is an annual coding challenge that runs from December 1st to 25th. It consists of tasks that become progressively more challenging as Christmas approaches, and that make for some fun logical problem solving. 

In this dojo, we will be working with some of the tasks from AoC 2023 (https://adventofcode.com/2023). The idea is that each dojo starts with whatever task they would like to solve, and then continue with the next task they would like to solve.
